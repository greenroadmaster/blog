### 1. Lord of the Flies By William Golding

Because it’s still deeply shocking for a young reader to discover what can happen when the rules of civilization fall away.

### 2. Lorna Doone By R.D. Blackmore

Because this is no sickly sweet romance. Holy cow, those Doones are wicked people and Lorna's caught in the middle

### 3. Jamaica Inn By Daphne du Maurier
Because it’s another wonderful stuck–in–the–middle tale. Twenty–year–old Mary Yellan is surrounded by murderous Cornish wreckers.

### 4. Kidnapped By Robert Louis Stevenson
Because it's better than Treasure Island and based on real people and real events. Alan Breck Stewart is a memorable character.

### 5. Treasure Island By Robert Louis Stevenson
Because I like to imagine hosting a dinner party featuring Long John Silver, Blind Pew, Ben Gunn and Billy Bones. More rum, more fun.

### 6. The Call of the Wild By Jack London
Because an animal tale should be on the list. This isn’t Marley and Me — Buck is a tough, tough dog in the Yukon Gold Rush.

### 7. Charlotte's Web By E.B. White
Because it might be the perfect bedtime read. I had to have children to discover this magical book of farmyard thinking.


### 8. The Wind in the Willows By Kenneth Grahame
Because this might also be the perfect bedtime read. Read it for Toad alone — so conceited, so arrogant, so resourceful.

### 9. Moonfleet By J. Meade Falkner
Because a great setting always helps. This smuggling tale is set on England’s south coast. Moonfleet is East Fleet on Dorset’s Chesil Beach.


### 10. Oliver Twist By Charles Dickens
Because it was no picnic being a child on the street in Victorian London. My favorite piece of Dickensian literature.
