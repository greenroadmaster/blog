### 1. Cider with Rosie By Laurie Lee
Because this is the best representation of rural childhood that I’ve come across. A slice of English history that everyone should read.


### 2. Goodbye to All That By Robert Graves
Because it’s the best anti–war book ever written. The passages describing Siegfried Sassoon's actions are particularly memorable.

### 3. In Cold Blood By Truman Capote
Because this book is so different than regular non-fiction. Capote’s bending all the rules as he dissects the murder of the Clutter family.


### 4. Seven Pillars of Wisdom By T.E. Lawrence
Because it seems almost impossible that one man can be this brilliant and do so much. A masterpiece of autobiography.

### 5. Bitter Lemons By Lawrence Durrell
Because it begins as a gentle travel memoir and turns into a painful description of Cyprus’ bloody campaign for independence.

### 6. Never Cry Wolf By Farley Mowat
Because Mowat practically lived with a pack of wolves and shattered misconception after misconception with this book.

### 7. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas By Hunter S. Thompson
Because this book is bonkers from beginning to end. Gonzo journalism starts here and it's a true non-fiction original.

### 8. Travels with a Donkey in Cevennes By Robert Louis Stevenson
Because this book pioneered two modern genres — travel literature and personal memoir. Readers owe much to Stevenson.

### 9. Homage to Catalonia By George Orwell
Because this war book is really about frustration as Orwell battles Fascism in Spain and takes a bullet in the throat for his troubles.

### 10. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee By Dee Brown
Because this book reinvented the modern non-fiction genre by revealing the truth behind the repression of Native Americans.
