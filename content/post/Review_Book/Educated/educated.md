## 줄거리

Tara Westover 의 회고록 Educated 는 가족의 독실하고 고립주의적인 종교적 신념에 맞서 투쟁하고 교육을 위해 투쟁하며 배움의 길을 따라 아이다호 시골에서 캠브리지 대학의 박사 과정에 이르는 여정을 따라간다. 

### 고향 Idaho에서의 이야기

시골 아이다호 카운티의 벅스 피크(Buck's Peak)라는 산 기슭에서 자란 Tara의 삶은 횡포한 아버지 Gene에 의해 지배되었다. 

그녀의 아버지 Gene은 미국 정부가 모든 시민의 자유를 박탈하기 위해 고안된 무신론적 교육, 사탄의 의료 행위, 감시 방법을 통해 시민들을 중독시키고 부패시키고 있다고 믿었던 카리스마 있지만 편집증적이고 망상적인 사람으로 자급자족하고 생존주의적인 생활 방식을 채택한 Gene은 어린 나이에 자신의 고철장 마당에서 자녀들을 일하게 하고 항상 임박했다고 믿었던 "가증의 날"을 대비하고 있다. 

Gene이 가족을 고립시키고 성경과 거친 산에서의 생활 방식 이외의 다른 응급 상황에서의 의료 지원이나 교육을 거부한 결과, Westover 가족은 많은 끔찍하고 쇠약한 사고를 겪는다. 

그녀의 어머니 Feye는 교통사고 후 뇌 손상을 입었으나 한 번도 병원치료를 받지 못했고, 그 결과 그녀는 극심한 편두통과 기억 상실을 겪습니다. 그녀는 "근육 검사"라는 손가락 동작을 통해 사람이 아픈지 아닌지를 판단할 수 있다고 믿었고 하나님으로부터 직접 복잡한 질문을 던졌습니다. Faye는 에센셜 오일 사업을 시작해 많은 돈을 벌었으며 가족에게 종말을 위한 지속적인 준비에 사용될 막대한 금액을 제공한다.

어린 소녀 Tara는 아버지의 폐품 마당에서 일했지만 그녀가 마을에서 만난 다른 아이들처럼 평범한 삶을 사는 것이 꿈으로 음악 레슨과 댄스 수업을 들었지만 Gene이 Tara의 의상이 무릎길이의 스웨트 셔츠를 보고 "창피한" 것이라고 하자, 그녀는 댄스를 그만두고 노래와 연극을 시작한다. 커뮤니티 연극 참여를 통해 그녀의 첫사랑인 Charles 와 같은 여러 친구들을 만났고 심지어 그녀의 오빠인 Shawn과도 유대감으로 시간을 보낸다. 

그녀의 오빠인 Shawn은 나이가 들어감에 따라 극장에서 만나고 데이트한 소녀들을 스토킹하고 괴롭히기 시작했고 곧 폭력을 Tara에게 돌렸다. Shawn은 항상 Tara에 대한 폭력적인 신체적, 정서적 폭행이 재미있고 게임이라고 주장했으며, 그들 사이의 학대와 화해 패턴은 수년 동안 통제할 수 없었다. Shawn이 건설 작업 중 일련의 사고로 영구적인 뇌 손상을 입었다. Tara는 그가 고통을 받아 폭력적이고 자제력을 잃었다고 생각했다.  
Tara는 이런 공포속에서 탈출하기로 했으며 가족을 탈출하는 유일한 방법으로 대학을 선택한다. 오빠 타일러의 격려로 집을 떠나 대학에 입학할 수 있을 만큼 열심히 공부한 그녀는 ACT를 위해 공부하고 명문 몰몬 교육 기관인 Brigham Young University에 지원했으며 합격했다.

### BYU에서의 이야기

Tara는 대학의 처음 몇년은 과거와 현재의 부조화로 인해 고통받으며 성장해 나가는 이야기이다. 새로운 환경에서 친구들에게서 문화적 차이에서 오는 충격을 받았고, 학교에서 배움을 통해 자신이 아는 세상이 점점 커가기 시작함으로 그동안 그녀가 알던 몰몬교에 대한 회의론도 들기 시작했다. 또한 방학과 휴가철에 고향으로 돌아갔지만 가족의 품에서 폭력과 무관심속에서 고뇌했다. BYU에서 Tara 주변의 사람들의 일상속에서 그녀는 세속적이라는 생각을 하게 된다. 평범한 몰몬 교도인 "이방인"에게 압도되었고 급우들에게 겁을 먹기 시작했다. 강의시간에는 흔히 알려진 사실도 모르는 경우가 있다. 강의 중 "홀로코스트"라는 용어를 언급하자 타라는 손을 들어 그 단어의 의미를 물었고, 반 친구들이 역겹다는 반응을 보인다. Tara는 홀로코스트의 파괴, 폭력, 슬픔과 대량학살에 대한 무지에 직면하여 도서관 컴퓨터에서 자신이 이 용어를 검색한 후 그녀는 자신이 주변 세계에 대해 진정으로 아는 것이 거의 없음을 깨닫는다.

여름과 휴가철 고향으로 돌아오지만. 가족방문을 통해 Tara는 Shawn의 폭행, 아버지의 무의미한 조소, 어머니의 냉정한 무관심의 폭력과 굴욕을 당한다. 오랜 세월 가족과 함께 하는 감정적인 줄다리기 때문에 감정적으로 위축되고 몸도 아프지만, 새로운 친구들, 교회 공동체, 교수들의 도움으로 그녀는 자립심과 스스로에 대한 책임감을 깨닫는다. Tara의 아버지가 산에서 사고로 심하게 화상을 입는다. 이 것은 몇년 전 형제 Luke가 겪었던 화상 처럼 되풀이 되지만 그들이 믿는 왜곡된 신념처럼 그녀의 가족이 계속해서 순환적이고 무의미한 고통을 겪는 것을 보면서 자신의 운명을 돌아본다. 

### 케임브리지와 하버드의 이야기

Tara는 명문 케임브리지 대학의 해외 유학 프로그램에 지원할 기회를 제안받았을 때 이를 수락한다. 하지만 자신과 가족 사이에 BYU이상의 거리로 떨어지고 그 가운데 바다를 끼는 것이 어떤 의미가 될지 두려운 마음이 든다. 케임브리지에서 Tara는 자신이 불안해하며 무가치하다고 느끼지만, 그녀의 교수들은 스펀지 같은 그녀의 두뇌에 깊은 인상을 받았으며, 그녀의 교육적 배경이 부족하다는 사실에 의아해하고 그녀의 이야기를 듣고나서 그녀의 교수들은 그녀를 열성적으로 지원하고 격려한다. 

케임브리지와 하버드 때론 파리를 오가며 그녀의 공부를 계속하지만 미국으로 돌아온 Tara는 몰몬 신앙과 가족 내에서 자신의 위치에 대해 계속 의문을 제기하며 부모님의 낡은 믿음, 끔찍한 인종차별, 말도 안되는 음모론이 결코 변하지 않을 것이라는 사실에 직면한다. 변하지 않은 오히려 어둡게 짙어진 가족과의 관계속에 불안과 공포로 고통스럽게 살기 시작한다. 

희망처럼 Tara의 형제 Tyler가 현재 상황을 들었고 그녀를 응원한다는 이메일을 보내고 이런 가족의 응원으로 기쁨이 열리고, 상담에 참석하기 시작하고 고통을 끝낼 힘을 찾고 어려운 진실을 극복해나가며 박사학위를 수여받고 남자친구와 런던으로 이사하며 둘은 자랑스럽고 진심으로 행복해한다.

### 여정의 끝으로

그러나 자신의 역사를 되찾으려면 Buck's Peak로 마지막 여행을 해야 한다는 것을 알고 있다. 할머니의 장례식을 위해 벅스 피크를 다시 찾았고 그곳에서 이모들과 만나고 그들의 사랑과 지원에서 위안을 찾는다. 나머지 가족이 함께 모여 있는 것을 보았지만 대부분 그녀의 앞을 쳐다보지도 않지만 Tara는 형제자매인 Tyler와 Richard와 함께 앉았다. 교육을 받기로 선택한 세 형제는 나머지 Westover 일족과 대척점에 있다. 

Tara는 자신이 교육을 받을 가치가 없는건 아닌지 혹은 교육을 받기로 선택한 사기꾼은 아니었는지 고뇌한다. 그녀는 항상 자신이 Buck's Peak의 폐품 야적장에서 일하는 남성 청바지를 입은 어린 소녀가 될까봐 두려워했고 동시에 그녀는 교육이 평생의 과정이라는 이해에서 도피처를 찾았다. 그녀의 교육은 변형, 배신, 변신을 고통스러워했지만 인간의 삶에서 피할 수 없는 부분으로 받아들인다.

### Part One

My strongest memory is not a memory. It’s something I imagined, then came to remember as if it had happened.

A YEAR AFTER MY FATHER told us that story, we gathered one evening to hear him read aloud from Isaiah, a prophecy about Immanuel.

AFTER DAD TOOK UP preaching against milk, Grandma jammed her fridge full of it. She and Grandpa only drank skim but pretty soon it was all there—two percent, whole, even chocolate. She seemed to believe this was an important line to hold.

I DIDN’T SLEEP THAT NIGHT. I sat on the kitchen floor and watched the hours tick by. One A.M. Two. Three.

At four I stood and put my boots by the back door. They were caked in manure, and I was sure Grandma wouldn’t let them into her car. I pictured them on her porch, abandoned, while I ran off shoeless to Arizona.

THE EVENT WAS A FAMOUS ONE, I would later learn—like Wounded Knee or Waco—but when my father first told us the story, it felt like no one in the world knew about it except us.

“Do you have calendula?” the midwife said. “I also need lobelia and witch hazel.”

THE FIRST TIME MOTHER assisted with a birth she was gone for two days. Then she wafted through the back door, so pale she seemed translucent, and drifted to the couch, where she stayed, trembling. “It was awful,” she whispered. “Even Judy said she was scared.” Mother closed her eyes. “She didn’t look scared.”
30 September, 2021 10:32 PM

LUKE WAS FIFTEEN WHEN he asked Mother if he could have a birth certificate. He wanted to enroll in Driver’s Ed because Tony, our oldest brother, was making good money driving rigs hauling gravel, which he could do because he had a license. Shawn and Tyler, the next oldest after Tony, had birth certificates; it was only the youngest four—Luke, Audrey, Richard and me—who didn’t.
30 September, 2021 10:32 PM

───

THAT FALL, WHEN I was nine, I went with Mother on a birth. I’d been asking to go for months, reminding her that Maria had seen a dozen births by the time she was my age. “I’m not a nursing mother,” she said. “I have no reason to take you. Besides, you wouldn’t like it.”

Eventually, Mother was hired by a woman who had several small children. It was arranged; I would tend them during the birth.

THERE WERE NO HERBALISTS in Wyoming as good as Mother, so a few months after the incident at the hospital, Judy came to Buck’s Peak to restock. The two women chatted in the kitchen, Judy perched on a barstool, Mother leaning across the counter, her head resting lazily in her hand.

My mother, Faye, was a mailman’s daughter. She grew up in town, in a yellow house with a white picket fence lined with purple irises. Her mother was a seamstress, the best in the valley some said, so as a young woman Faye wore beautiful clothes, all perfectly tailored, from velvet jackets and polyester trousers to woolen pantsuits and gabardine dresses.

MY FATHER, GENE, WAS one of those young men who somehow manage to seem both solemn and mischievous. His physical appearance was striking—ebony hair, a strict, angular face, nose like an arrow pointing toward fierce, deep-set eyes. His lips were often pressed together in a jocular grin, as if all the world were his to laugh at.

MOTHER USED TO TELL a story from the time before she was married. She had been close to her brother Lynn, so she took him to meet the man she hoped would be her husband. It was summer, dusk, and Dad’s cousins were roughhousing the way they did after a harvest. Lynn arrived and, seeing a room of bowlegged ruffians shouting at each other, fists clenched, swiping at the air, thought he was witnessing a brawl straight out of a John Wayne film. He wanted to call the police.

GRANDMA-OVER-IN-TOWN DIED THREE YEARS ago, age eighty-six.

I didn’t know her well.

All those years I was passing in and out of her kitchen, and she never told me what it had been like for her, watching her daughter shut herself away, walled in by phantoms and paranoias.

No one saw the car leave the road. My brother Tyler, who was seventeen, fell asleep at the wheel. It was six in the morning and he’d been driving in silence for most of the night, piloting our station wagon through Arizona, Nevada and Utah. We were in Cornish, a farming town twenty miles south of Buck’s Peak, when the station wagon drifted over the center line into the other lane, then left the highway. The car jumped a ditch, smashed through two utility poles of thick cedar, and was finally brought to a stop only when it collided with a row-crop tractor.
30 September, 2021 10:35 PM

───

THE TRIP HAD BEEN Mother’s idea.

A few months earlier, when crisp leaves had begun slipping to the ground, signaling the end of summer, Dad had been in high spirits.

IT WAS A SCORCHING AFTERNOON, so hot you couldn’t walk barefoot on the pavement, when Grandma took me and Richard for a drive through the desert, having wrestled us into seatbelts, which we’d never worn before. 
30 September, 2021 10:35 PM

───

I AWOKE WHEN THE CAR HIT the first utility pole.

The mountain thawed and the Princess appeared on its face, her head brushing the sky. It was Sunday, a month after the accident, and everyone had gathered in the living room. Dad had begun to expound a scripture when Tyler cleared his throat and said he was leaving.

“I’m g-g-going to c-college,” he said, his face rigid.
30 September, 2021 10:36 PM

───

I DIDN’T BELIEVE TYLER would really go to college, that he would ever abandon the mountain to join the Illuminati.
30 September, 2021 10:37 PM

WEEKS PASSED AND IT was full summer. One Sunday Dad called the family together. “We’ve got a good supply of food,” he said. “We’ve got fuel and water stored away. What we don’t got is money.” Dad took a twenty from his wallet and crumpled it. “Not this fake money. In the Days of Abomination, this won’t be worth a thing. People will trade hundred-dollar bills for a roll of toilet paper.”
30 September, 2021 10:37 PM

───

I AWOKE ONE MORNING in August to find Tyler packing his clothes, books and CDs into boxes. 
30 September, 2021 10:37 PM

───

SUMMER WANED, SEEMING TO evaporate in its own heat. The days were still hot but the evenings had begun to cool, the frigid hours after sunset claiming more of each day. Tyler had been gone a month.
30 September, 2021 10:39 PM

───

The winter after Tyler left, Audrey turned fifteen. She picked up her driver’s license from the county courthouse and, on her way home, got a job flipping burgers. Then she took a second job milking cows at four A.M. every morning. For a year she’d been fighting with Dad, bucking under the restraints he put on her. Now she had money; she had her own car; we hardly saw her. The family was shrinking, the old hierarchy compressing.
30 September, 2021 10:40 PM

───

I WASN’T THE ONLY ONE whose feet were searching for solid ground. For six months after the car accident, Mother had improved steadily and we’d thought she would fully recover.
30 September, 2021 10:40 PM

───

THE MEMORY OF TYLER haunted me that winter. I remembered the day he left, how strange it was to see his car bumping down the hill loaded with boxes. I couldn’t imagine where he was now, but sometimes I wondered if perhaps school was less evil than Dad thought, because Tyler was the least evil person I knew, and he loved school—loved it more, it seemed, than he loved us.
30 September, 2021 10:41 PM

───

TYLER WAS GONE. There was hardly a trace he’d ever lived in the house, except one: every night, after dinner, I would close the door to my room and pull Tyler’s old boom box from under my bed. I’d dragged his desk into my room, and while the choir sang I would settle into his chair and study, just as I’d seen him do on a thousand nights. I didn’t study history or math. I studied religion.
30 September, 2021 10:41 PM

───

BY THE TIME THE SNOW on the mountain began to melt, my hands were thickly callused. A season in the junkyard had honed my reflexes: I’d learned to listen for the low grunt that escaped Dad’s lips whenever he tossed something heavy, and when I heard it I hit the dirt. I spent so much time flat in the mud, I didn’t salvage much. Dad joked I was as slow as molasses running uphill.
30 September, 2021 10:41 PM

───

It was a rainless summer. The sun blazed across the sky each afternoon, scorching the mountain with its arid, desiccating heat, so that each morning when I crossed the field to the barn, I felt stalks of wild wheat crackle and break beneath my feet.
30 September, 2021 10:41 PM

───

I’D STACKED THE DIRTY dishes and was filling the kitchen sink when I heard it—a shrill, strangled cry that began in one key and ended in another. There was no question it was human. I’d never heard an animal bellow like that, with such fluctuations in tone and pitch.
30 September, 2021 10:42 PM

───

FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS I never thought of that day, not in any probing way. The few times my reminiscing carried me back to that torrid afternoon, what I remembered first was the belt. Luke, I would think. You wild dog. I wonder, do you still wear twine?
30 September, 2021 10:43 PM

───

MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT guilty after the recital, because in the weeks that followed she searched for something else I could do, something Dad wouldn’t forbid. She’d noticed the hours I spent in my room with Tyler’s old boom box, listening to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, so she began looking for a voice teacher.

The summer I sang the lead for Annie it was 1999. My father was in serious preparedness mode. Not since I was five, and the Weavers were under siege, had he been so certain that the Days of Abomination were upon us.

I HAD REHEARSALS MOST NIGHTS at the Worm Creek Opera House, a dilapidated theater near the only stoplight in town. The play was another world. Nobody talked about Y2K.
30 September, 2021 10:44 PM

───

IT WAS AT THE Worm Creek Opera House that I first saw him: a boy I didn’t know, laughing with a group of public school kids, wearing big white shoes, khaki shorts and a wide grin. He wasn’t in the play, but there wasn’t much to do in town, and I saw him several more times that week when he turned up to visit his friends. Then one night, when I was wandering alone in the dark wings backstage, I turned a corner and found him sitting on the wooden crate that was a favorite haunt of mine. The crate was isolated—that was why I liked it.

───

 It took more than an hour, and when they’d finished they stood back, revealing what looked like an enormous military-green telescope, with its long barrel set firmly atop a short, broad tripod. Richard was so excited he was hopping from one foot to the other, reciting what it could do. “Got a range more than a mile! Can bring down a helicopter!”
30 September, 2021 10:45 PM

───

I CAME HOME ONE AFTERNOON from packing macadamias to find Dad and Richard gathered around a large metal box, which they’d hefted onto the kitchen table. While Mother and I cooked meatloaf, they assembled the contents.
30 September, 2021 10:45 PM

───

CHRISTMAS WAS SPARSE THAT YEAR. We weren’t poor—Mother’s business was doing well and Dad was still scrapping—but we’d spent everything on supplies.
30 September, 2021 10:47 PM

───

When January 1 dawned like any other morning, it broke Dad’s spirit. He never again mentioned Y2K. He slipped into despondency, dragging himself in from the junkyard each night, silent and heavy. He’d sit in front of the TV for hours, a black cloud hovering.
30 September, 2021 10:48 PM

───

I AWOKE TO BLACKNESS. Something ice-cold was running down my back. We’re in a lake! I thought. Something heavy was on top of me. The mattress. I tried to kick it off but couldn’t, so I crawled beneath it, my hands and knees pressing into the ceiling of the van, which was upside down. I came to a broken window. It was full of snow. Then I understood: we were in a field, not a lake. I crawled through the broken glass and stood, unsteadily. I couldn’t seem to gain my balance. I looked around but saw no one. The van was empty. My family was gone.
30 September, 2021 10:49 PM

───

A FEW DAYS AFTER the crash, my neck froze.

I awoke one morning and it wouldn’t move. It didn’t hurt, not at first, but no matter how hard I concentrated on turning my head, it wouldn’t give more than an inch. The paralysis spread lower, until it felt like I had a metal rod running the length of my back and into my skull. When I couldn’t bend forward or turn my head, the soreness set in. I had a constant, crippling headache, and I couldn’t stand without holding on to something.
30 September, 2021 10:49 PM

───

DURING THE MONTH I was in bed I heard another voice. I remembered it but it was no longer familiar to me. It had been six years since that impish laugh had echoed down the hall.
30 September, 2021 10:50 PM

───

When Grandpa-down-the-hill was a young man, there’d been herds of livestock spread across the mountain, and they were tended on horseback. Grandpa’s ranching horses were the stuff of legend. Seasoned as old leather, they moved their burly bodies delicately, as if guided by the rider’s thoughts.
30 September, 2021 10:50 PM

SHAWN SAID HE WANTED out of his old life, and that the first step was to stay away from his friends. Suddenly he was home every evening, looking for something to do. He began to drive me to my rehearsals at Worm Creek. When it was just the two of us floating down the highway, he was mellow, lighthearted. He joked and teased, and he sometimes gave me advice, which was mostly “Don’t do what I did.” But when we arrived at the theater, he would change.
30 September, 2021 10:50 PM

───

IT WAS A HAZY summer evening, a month before I turned fifteen. The sun had dipped below Buck’s Peak but the sky still held a few hours of light. Shawn and I were in the corral. After breaking Bud that spring, Shawn had taken up horses in a serious way. 
30 September, 2021 10:50 PM

───

My brother Tony had taken out a loan to buy his own rig—a semi and trailer—but in order to make the payments, he had to keep the truck on the road, so that’s where he was living, on the road. Until his wife got sick and the doctor she consulted (she had consulted a doctor) put her on bed rest. Tony called Shawn and asked if he could run the rig for a week or two.
30 September, 2021 10:50 PM

───

THE WORM CREEK OPERA HOUSE announced a new play: Carousel. Shawn drove me to the audition, then surprised me by auditioning himself. Charles was also there, talking to a girl named Sadie, who was seventeen. She nodded at what Charles was saying, but her eyes were fixed on Shawn.
30 September, 2021 10:51 PM

───

SADIE’S PARENTS WERE DIVORCING and the town was awash in rumors about her father. When Mother heard the rumors, she said now it made sense why Shawn had taken an interest in Sadie. “He’s always protected angels with broken wings,” she said.
30 September, 2021 10:51 PM

───

In September the twin towers fell. I’d never heard of them until they were gone. Then I watched as planes sank into them, and I stared, bewildered, at the TV as the unimaginably tall structures swayed, then buckled.
30 September, 2021 10:51 PM

───

SHAWN AND I AUDITIONED for a melodrama at Worm Creek. I saw Charles at the first rehearsal and spent half the evening working up the courage to talk to him. When I did, finally, he confided in me that he was in love with Sadie. This wasn’t ideal, but it did give us something to talk about.
30 September, 2021 10:52 PM

───

I AWOKE WITH NEEDLES in my brain. Thousands of them, biting, blocking out everything. Then they disappeared for one dizzying moment and I got my bearings.
30 September, 2021 10:52 PM

───

THAT NIGHT, WHEN I came home, Shawn was gone. Mother was in the kitchen blending oils. She said nothing about that morning, and I knew I shouldn’t mention it. I went to bed, but I was still awake hours later when I heard a pickup roar up the hill. A few minutes later, my bedroom door creaked open. I heard the click of the lamp, saw the light leaping over the walls, and felt his weight drop onto my bed. I turned over and faced him. He’d put a black velvet box next to me. When I didn’t touch it, he opened the box and withdrew a string of milky pearls.
30 September, 2021 10:54 PM

───

WHEN I AWOKE THE next morning, my neck was bruised and my wrist swollen. I had a headache—not an ache in my brain but an actual aching of my brain, as if the organ itself was tender. 
30 September, 2021 10:54 PM

───

In October Dad won a contract to build industrial granaries in Malad City, the dusty farm town on the other side of Buck’s Peak. It was a big job for a small outfit—the crew was just Dad, Shawn, Luke, and Audrey’s husband, Benjamin—but Shawn was a good foreman, and with him in charge Dad had acquired a reputation for fast, reliable work.
30 September, 2021 10:54 PM

───

I WORKED LATE MOST NIGHTS. Randy planned to take a big road trip to find new accounts, and he’d asked me to manage the business while he was gone. He taught me how to use his computer to keep the books, process orders, maintain inventory. It was from Randy that I first heard of the Internet. He showed me how to get online, how to visit a webpage, how to write an email. The day he left, he gave me a cellphone so he could reach me at all hours.
30 September, 2021 10:54 PM

───

EVERY EVENING, AS THE CREW was leaving Malad, Dad would phone the house so Mother could have dinner waiting when the truck bumped up the hill. I listened for that call, and when it came I would get in Mother’s car and drive away. I didn’t know why. I would go to Worm Creek, where I’d sit in the balcony and watch rehearsals, my feet on the ledge, a math book open in front of me. I hadn’t studied math since long division, and the concepts were unfamiliar. I understood the theory of fractions but struggled to manipulate them, and seeing a decimal on the page made my heart race. Every night for a month I sat in the opera house, in a chair of red velvet, and practiced the most basic operations—how to multiply fractions, how to use a reciprocal, how to add and multiply and divide with decimals—while on the stage, characters recited their lines.
30 September, 2021 10:55 PM

───

I STUDIED TRIGONOMETRY FOR a month. I sometimes dreamed about sine, cosine and tangent, about mysterious angles and concussed computations, but for all this I made no real progress. I could not self-teach trigonometry. But I knew someone who had.
30 September, 2021 10:55 PM

───

MOTHER HAD LITTLE INFORMATION. Shawn had fallen. He’d landed on his head. Someone had called 911, and he’d been airlifted to a hospital in Pocatello. The doctors weren’t sure if he would live. That was all she knew.
30 September, 2021 10:55 PM

───

SHAWN LIVED THROUGH THE NIGHT.

In the morning I drove to Buck’s Peak. I couldn’t explain why I wasn’t rushing to my brother’s bedside. I told Mother I had to work.
30 September, 2021 10:55 PM

───

There was a moment that winter. I was kneeling on the carpet, listening to Dad testify of Mother’s calling as a healer, when my breath caught in my chest and I felt taken out of myself. I no longer saw my parents or our living room. What I saw was a woman grown, with her own mind, her own prayers, who no longer sat, childlike, at her father’s feet.
30 September, 2021 10:56 PM

───

I WAS LYING ON MY BED, watching the shadows my feeble lamp cast on the ceiling, when I heard my father’s voice at the door. Instinctively I jerked to my feet in a kind of salute, but once I was standing I wasn’t sure what to do. There was no precedent for this: my father had never visited my room before.
30 September, 2021 10:56 PM

───

WITHOUT SHAWN AS FOREMAN, Dad’s construction business dwindled. I’d quit my job at Randy’s to look after Shawn. Now I needed money, so when Dad went back to scrapping that winter, so did I.
30 September, 2021 10:56 PM

───

THERE WAS AN UNUSUALLY hot day that spring, and Luke and I spent it hauling purlins—the iron beams that run horizontally along the length of a roof. 
30 September, 2021 10:56 PM

───

I WAS HOARDING MY PAYCHECKS, in case I needed the money for tuition. Dad noticed and started charging me for small things. Mother had gone back to buying insurance after the second car accident, and Dad said I should pay my share. So I did. Then he wanted more, for registration. “These Government fees will break you,” he said as I handed him the cash.
30 September, 2021 10:56 PM

───

SHAWN RETURNED TO WORK, hobbling unsteadily. 
30 September, 2021 10:56 PM

───

Construction began on the milking barn in Oneida. Shawn designed and welded the main frame—the massive beams that formed the skeleton of the building. 
30 September, 2021 10:57 PM

───

IT WAS A SATURDAY NIGHT. I was at Grandma-over-in-town’s, my math book propped open on the kitchen table, a plate of cookies next to me. I was studying to retake the ACT. I often studied at Grandma’s so Dad wouldn’t lecture me.
30 September, 2021 10:57 PM

───

I’D NEVER BEEN TO the hospital in town, but it was easy to find.

Dwain had asked me what the hell I was doing when I flipped a U-turn and accelerated down the hillside. I’d listened to Shawn’s shallow breathing as I raced through the valley, along Fivemile Creek, then shot up the Bear River Hill. At the hospital, I parked in the emergency lane, and Dwain and I carried Shawn through the glass doors. I shouted for help. A nurse appeared, running, then another. Shawn was conscious by then. They took him away and someone shoved me into the waiting room.
30 September, 2021 10:58 PM

───

THE ENVELOPE ARRIVED THREE weeks later, just as Shawn was getting back on his feet. I tore it open, feeling numb, as if I were reading my sentence after the guilty verdict had already been handed down. I scanned down to the composite score. Twenty-eight. I checked it again. I checked my name. There was no mistake. Somehow—and a miracle was the only way I could account for it—I’d done it.
30 September, 2021 10:58 PM

───

THREE DAYS BEFORE I turned seventeen, Mother drove me to Utah to find an apartment.
30 September, 2021 10:58 PM

───

WAITING FOR CHRISTMAS THAT year felt like waiting to walk off the edge of a cliff. Not since Y2K had I felt so certain that something terrible was coming, something that would obliterate everything I’d known before. 
30 September, 2021 10:58 PM

───

### Part Two

On New Year’s Day, Mother drove me to my new life. I didn’t take much with me: a dozen jars of home-canned peaches, bedding, and a garbage bag full of clothes.
30 September, 2021 10:58 PM

───

THE NEXT MORNING, I got on the bus going the wrong direction. By the time I’d corrected my mistake, the lecture was nearly finished.
30 September, 2021 10:59 PM

───

THAT SATURDAY, I SAT at my desk with a stack of homework. Everything had to be finished that day because I could not violate the Sabbath.
30 September, 2021 10:59 PM

───

After that, I rarely spoke to Shannon or Mary and they rarely spoke to me, except to remind me to do my share of the chores, which I never did. The apartment looked fine to me.
30 September, 2021 10:59 PM

───

MY BANK ACCOUNT DECREASED steadily.
30 September, 2021 10:59 PM

───

ONE WINTER, WHEN I was very young, Luke found a great horned owl in the pasture, unconscious and half frozen.
30 September, 2021 10:59 PM

───

IN MARCH, THERE WAS ANOTHER exam in Western Civ.
30 September, 2021 11:00 PM

───

When the semester ended I returned to Buck’s Peak. In a few weeks BYU would post grades; then I’d know if I could return in the fall.
30 September, 2021 11:00 PM

───

MY MEMORIES OF THE UNIVERSITY faded quickly.
30 September, 2021 11:00 PM

───

ON THURSDAY, AFTER I’D finished scrapping, I drove forty miles to the nearest Walmart and bought a pair of women’s jeans and two shirts, both blue. 
30 September, 2021 11:00 PM

───

Charles was my first friend from that other world, the one my father had tried to protect me from.
30 September, 2021 11:01 PM

───

THE SUMMER SHAWN AND I had worked the Shear, there’d been an afternoon when I’d wiped the sweat from my face so many times that, by the time we quit for supper, my nose and cheeks had been black. That was the first time Shawn called me “Nigger.”
30 September, 2021 11:01 PM

───

“OUR NIGGER’S BACK!”

I don’t know what Shawn saw on my face
30 September, 2021 11:01 PM

───

Dad paid me the day before I returned to BYU. He didn’t have the money to give what he’d promised, but it was enough to cover the half tuition I owed. I spent my last day in Idaho with Charles.
30 September, 2021 11:01 PM

───

MOTHER WAS SUPPOSED TO drive me to BYU the next morning, but during the night, she was called to deliver a baby. There was a car sitting in the driveway—a Kia Sephia Dad had bought from Tony a few weeks before. The keys were in the ignition. I loaded my stuff into it and drove it to Utah, figuring the car would just about make up for the money Dad owed me. I guess he figured that, too, because he never said a word about it.
30 September, 2021 11:02 PM

───

When I arrived at the peak, Mother was making the Thanksgiving meal. The large oak table was covered with jars of tincture and vials of essential oil, which I cleared away. Charles was coming for dinner.
30 September, 2021 11:02 PM

───

WINTER COVERED CAMPUS IN thick snow.
30 September, 2021 11:02 PM

───

BUCK’S PEAK LOOKED THE way it always did at Christmas—a snowy spire, adorned with evergreens—and my eyes, increasingly accustomed to brick and concrete, were nearly blinded by the scale and clarity of it.
30 September, 2021 11:03 PM

───

THE SHOP IN FRANKLIN was ready to roof, so two days after Christmas I forced my toe, still crooked and black, into a steel-toed boot, then spent the morning on a roof driving threading screws into galvanized tin.
30 September, 2021 11:03 PM

───

“I DON’T KNOW WHAT you’ve done to your wrist,” Dad told me the next morning, “but you’re no good on the crew like that. You might as well head back to Utah.”
30 September, 2021 11:03 PM

───

On Sunday, a week later, a man at church asked me to dinner. I said no. It happened a second time a few days later with a different man. Again I said no. I couldn’t say yes. I didn’t want either of them anywhere near me.
29 September, 2021 03:12 PM

───

I STOOD OUTSIDE THE bishop’s office on a cold night in February. I didn’t know what had taken me there.
30 September, 2021 11:03 PM

───

“I can help,” he said, “but you’ll need to tell me what’s bothering you.” 
29 September, 2021 03:27 PM

───

 Dad said that to accept one was to indebt yourself to the Illuminati. “That’s how they get you,” he’d said. “They give you free money, then the next thing you know, they own you.”
29 September, 2021 03:33 PM

───

I HAD A JOB at the campus creamery, flipping burgers and scooping ice cream. I got by between paydays by neglecting overdue bills and borrowing money from Robin, so twice a month, when a few hundred dollars went into my account, it was gone within hours. 
29 September, 2021 03:57 PM

───

I HAD A JOB at the campus creamery, flipping burgers and scooping ice cream.
30 September, 2021 11:05 PM

───

I was an incurious student that semester.
29 September, 2021 03:58 PM

───

That was it, then. There was nothing left to sell, no more childhood friends or Christmas presents.
29 September, 2021 04:01 PM

───

I BELIEVED THAT HUNDRED dollars was a sign from God. 
29 September, 2021 04:03 PM

───

THE FORMS SAT ON my desk for a week before Robin walked with me to the post office and watched me hand them to the postal worker. It didn’t take long, a week, maybe two. I was cleaning houses in Draper when the mail came, so Robin left the letter on my bed with a note that I was a Commie now.
30 September, 2021 11:06 PM

───

I had a thousand dollars in my bank account. It felt strange just to think that, let alone say it. A thousand dollars. Extra. That I did not immediately need. It took weeks for me to come to terms with this fact, but as I did, I began to experience the most powerful advantage of money: the ability to think of things besides money.
30 September, 2021 11:06 PM

───

I BECAME OBSESSED WITH bipolar disorder. We were required to write a research paper for Psychology and I chose it as my subject, then used the paper as an excuse to interrogate every neuroscientist and cognitive specialist at the university. I described Dad’s symptoms, attributing them not to my father but to a fictive uncle. Some of the symptoms fit perfectly; others did not. The professors told me that every case is different.
30 September, 2021 11:07 PM

───

I DECIDED TO EXPERIMENT with normality. For nineteen years I’d lived the way my father wanted. Now I would try something else.
29 September, 2021 04:17 PM

───

I BEGAN TO FEEL poorly toward the end of May. A week passed in which I could hardly drag myself to my job, an internship at a law firm. I slept from early evening until late morning, then yawned through the day. My throat began to ache and my voice dropped, roughening into a deep crackle, as if my vocal cords had turned to sandpaper.
30 September, 2021 11:08 PM

───

I AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING to my phone ringing. It was Audrey.

“There’s been an accident,” she said.
29 September, 2021 04:21 PM

───

There’s a story I was told when I was young, told so many times and from such an early age, I can’t remember who told it to me first. It was about Grandpa-down-the-hill and how he got the dent above his right temple.
30 September, 2021 11:08 PM

───

When Grandpa was a younger man, he had spent a hot summer on the mountain, riding the white mare he used for cowboy work.
29 September, 2021 04:23 PM

───

I DON’T KNOW WHY Dad was alone on the mountain that day.
29 September, 2021 04:24 PM

───

MOTHER’S BUSINESS CAME TO a halt. The women who worked for her stopped concocting tinctures and bottling oils and instead made vats of salve—a new recipe, of comfrey, lobelia and plantain, that Mother had concocted specifically for my father.
29 September, 2021 04:40 PM

───

Dad didn’t leave his bed for two months unless one of my brothers was carrying him. He peed in a bottle, and the enemas continued. Even after it became clear that he would live, we had no idea what kind of life it would be.
29 September, 2021 04:41 PM

───

DAD WAS STILL BEDRIDDEN when Shawn and Emily announced their engagement.
29 September, 2021 04:42 PM

───

I RETURNED TO BYU a few days before the fall semester. 
29 September, 2021 04:44 PM

───

I RETURNED TO BYU a few days before the fall semester. I drove directly to Nick’s apartment. We’d hardly spoken. Whenever he called, I always seemed to be needed somewhere to change a bandage or make salve. Nick knew my father had been burned, but he didn’t know the severity of it. I’d withheld more information than I’d given, never saying that there had been an explosion, or that when I “visited” my father it wasn’t in a hospital but in our living room. I hadn’t told Nick about his heart stopping. I hadn’t described the gnarled hands, or the enemas, or the pounds of liquefied tissue we’d scraped off his body.
30 September, 2021 11:09 PM

───

THE WEDDING WAS IN SEPTEMBER.
29 September, 2021 04:45 PM

───

I’d come to BYU to study music, so that one day I could direct a church choir. But that semester—the fall of my junior year—I didn’t enroll in a single music course. I couldn’t have explained why I dropped advanced music theory in favor of geography and comparative politics, or gave up sight-singing to take History of the Jews.
29 September, 2021 06:31 PM

───

EMILY WAS PREGNANT. THE pregnancy was not going well.
29 September, 2021 06:49 PM

───

A FEW WEEKS AFTER CHRISTMAS, the University of Cambridge wrote to Dr. Kerry, rejecting my application.
29 September, 2021 06:50 PM

───

IN FEBRUARY, EMILY GAVE BIRTH. The baby weighed one pound, four ounces.
29 September, 2021 06:50 PM

───

The first time I saw King’s College, Cambridge, I didn’t think I was dreaming, but only because my imagination had never produced anything so grand.
29 September, 2021 06:51 PM

───

I WANTED THE MIND of a scholar, but it seemed that Dr. Kerry saw in me the mind of a roofer. 
29 September, 2021 07:06 PM

───

“I grew up in Idaho,” I said.

“And you attended school there?”

It occurs to me in retrospect that someone might have told Professor Steinberg about me, 
29 September, 2021 07:16 PM

───

“How marvelous,” he said, smiling. “It’s as if I’ve stepped into Shaw’s Pygmalion.”
29 September, 2021 07:16 PM

───

A poorly written sentence was a poorly conceived idea, and in his view the grammatical logic was as much in need of correction. “Tell me,” he would say
29 September, 2021 07:17 PM

───

To write my essay I had to read books differently, without giving myself over to either fear or adoration. Because Burke had defended the British monarchy, Dad would have said he was an agent of tyranny.
29 September, 2021 07:21 PM

───

“I have been teaching in Cambridge for thirty years,” he said. “And this is one of the best essays I’ve read.”

I was prepared for insults but not for this.
29 September, 2021 07:23 PM

───

“This is a magical place,” I said. “Everything shines here.”

“You must stop yourself from thinking like that,” Dr. Kerry said, his voice raised. “You are not fool’s gold, shining only under a particular light. Whomever you become, whatever you make yourself into, that is who you always were. It was always in you. Not in Cambridge. In you. You are gold. And returning to BYU, or even to that mountain you came from, will not change who you are. It may change how others see you, it may even change how you see yourself—even gold appears dull in some lighting—but that is the illusion. And it always was.”
29 September, 2021 07:26 PM

───

I couldn’t tell Dr. Kerry about that girl. I couldn’t tell him that the reason I couldn’t return to Cambridge was that being here threw into great relief every violent and degrading moment of my life. At BYU I could almost forget, allow what had been to blend into what was. But the contrast here was too great, the world before my eyes too fantastical. The memories were more real—more believable—than the stone spires.

To myself I pretended there were other reasons I couldn’t belong at Cambridge, reasons having to do with class and status: that it was because I was poor, had grown up poor. Because I could stand in the wind on the chapel roof and not tilt. That was the person who didn’t belong in Cambridge: the roofer, not the whore. I can go to school, I had written in my journal that very afternoon. And I can buy new clothes. But I am still Tara Westover. I have done jobs no Cambridge student would do. Dress us any way you like, we are not the same. Clothes could not fix what was wrong with me. Something had rotted on the inside, and the stench was too powerful, the core too rancid, to be covered up by mere dressings.

Whether Dr. Kerry suspected any part of this, I’m not sure. But he understood that I had fixated on clothes as the symbol of why I didn’t, and couldn’t, belong. It was the last thing he said to me before he walked away, leaving me rooted, astonished, beside that grand chapel.

“The most powerful determinant of who you are is inside you,” he said. “Professor Steinberg says this is Pygmalion. Think of the story, Tara.” He paused, his eyes fierce, his voice piercing. “She was just a cockney in a nice dress. Until she believed in herself. Then it didn’t matter what dress she wore.”

Two weeks before the interview my parents came to BYU.
29 September, 2021 07:35 PM

“Is that Martin Luther King?” Dad said. “Don’t you know he had ties to communism?” He chewed the waxy tissue where his lips had been.
29 September, 2021 07:37 PM

───

MY INTERVIEW FOR THE Gates scholarship took place at St. John’s College in Annapolis.
29 September, 2021 07:38 PM

I received confirmation the next day: I’d won the scholarship.

The phone calls began—from BYU’s student paper and the local news. 
29 September, 2021 07:38 PM

A MONTH BEFORE MY graduation, I visited Buck’s Peak. 
29 September, 2021 07:38 PM

There was a dinner the night before my graduation where I was to receive the “most outstanding undergraduate” award from the history department.

### Part Three

A stone gate barred the entrance to Trinity College. Cut into the gate was a small wooden door. I stepped through it. 
30 September, 2021 09:38 PM

───

I STUDIED MOST MORNINGS in the college library, near a small window.
30 September, 2021 09:39 PM

───

I ATTENDED A SEMINAR on Wednesday afternoons, where I noticed two women, Katrina and Sophie, who nearly always sat together.
30 September, 2021 09:40 PM

───

IN DECEMBER, AFTER I had submitted my last essay, I took a train to London and boarded a plane. Mother, Audrey and Emily picked me up at the airport in Salt Lake City, and together we skidded onto the interstate.
30 September, 2021 09:55 PM

───

MOTHER WAS OVERWHELMED WITH holiday orders, so I passed my days on Buck’s Peak just as I had as a child: in the kitchen, making homeopathics.
30 September, 2021 09:55 PM

───

The day before I returned to England, I drove seven miles along the mountain range, then turned onto a narrow dirt road and stopped in front of a powder-blue house. I parked behind an RV that was nearly as large as the house itself. I knocked; my sister answered.
30 September, 2021 09:56 PM

───

THAT TERM, I PRESENTED myself to the university like resin to a sculptor. I believed I could be remade, my mind recast. I forced myself to befriend other students, clumsily introducing myself again and again until I had a small circle of friends.
30 September, 2021 09:58 PM

───

I OPENED AUDREY’S MESSAGE. It was written in one long paragraph, with little punctuation and many spelling errors, and at first I fixated on these grammatical irregularities as a way to mute the text. But the words would not be hushed; they shouted at me from the screen.

MOTHER AND I SPOKE only once about that conversation, on the phone, a week later. “It’s being dealt with,” she said. “I told your father what you and your sister said. Shawn will get help.”

When I next returned to Buck’s Peak, it was autumn and Grandma-down-the-hill was dying. For nine years she had battled the cancer in her bone marrow; now the contest was ending.

───

I didn’t stay long on Buck’s Peak, maybe a week. On the day I left the mountain, Audrey asked me not to go.

───

DREW HAD COME WITH me to Cambridge, having been admitted to a master’s program in Middle Eastern studies.

BUCK’S PEAK WAS UNCHANGED. The Princess was buried in snow but I could see the deep contours of her legs.

───

I didn’t feel particularly brave as I approached my father in the Chapel that night. I saw my role as reconnaissance: I was there to relay information, to tell Dad that Shawn had threatened Audrey, because Dad would know what to do.
30 September, 2021 10:05 PM

───

I WENT TO MY ROOM and shut the door, quietly sliding the bolt, and called Drew. I was nearly incoherent with panic but eventually he understood. He said I should leave, right now, and he’d meet me halfway. I can’t, I said. At this moment things are calm. If I try to run off in the middle of the night, I don’t know what will happen.
30 September, 2021 10:05 PM

───

I DON’T KNOW WHAT happened in the days that followed. Even now, as I scrutinize the components of the confrontation—the threat, the denial, the lecture, the apology—it is difficult to relate them.
30 September, 2021 10:05 PM

───

I fled the mountain with my bags half packed and did not retrieve anything that was left behind. I went to Salt Lake and spent the rest of the holidays with Drew.

───

I HAD A GRANT to study that summer in Paris. Drew came with me. Our flat was in the sixth arrondissement, near the Luxembourg Gardens.

WHEN I LOST MY SISTER, I lost my family.

I knew my father would pay my brothers the same visit he’d paid her. Would they believe him? I thought they would. After all, Audrey would confirm it. My denials would be meaningless, the rantings of a stranger. I’d wandered too far, changed too much, bore too little resemblance to the scabby-kneed girl they remembered as their sister.

It was a sunny September afternoon when I heaved my suitcase through Harvard Yard. The colonial architecture felt foreign but also crisp and unimposing compared to the Gothic pinnacles of Cambridge. The central library, called the Widener, was the largest I had ever seen, and for a few minutes I forgot the past year and stared up at it, wonderstruck.

MY PARENTS ARRIVED AS the leaves began to turn, when campus was at its most beautiful, the reds and yellows of autumn mingling with the burgundy of colonial brick. With his hayseed grammar, denim shirt and lifetime-member NRA cap,

WHEN WE RETURNED TO HARVARD, I offered to pay for a hotel. They refused to go. For a week we stumbled over one another in my dorm room. Every morning my father trudged up a flight of stairs to the communal shower in nothing but a small white towel. This would have humiliated me at BYU, but at Harvard I shrugged. I had transcended embarrassment. What did it matter who saw him, or what he said to them, or how shocked they were? It was his opinion I cared about; he was the one I was losing.
30 September, 2021 10:11 PM

───

Someone was screaming, a long, steady holler, so loud it woke me up. It was dark. There were streetlights, pavement, the rumble of distant cars. I was standing in the middle of Oxford Street, half a block from my dorm room. 
30 September, 2021 10:12 PM

───

I STOPPED GOING TO my French group, then to my sketching class. Instead of reading in the library or attending lectures, I watched TV in my room, working my way through every popular series from the past two decades.
30 September, 2021 10:14 PM

───

IT WAS A BRIGHT WINTER morning when I arrived on Buck’s Peak. I remember the crisp smell of frozen earth as I approached the house and the feel of ice and gravel crunching beneath my boots. The sky was a shocking blue. I breathed in the welcome scent of pine.
30 September, 2021 10:14 PM

───

I DROVE SOUTH; I didn’t know where I was going. It was nearly Christmas. I had decided to go to the airport and board the next flight to Boston when Tyler called.
30 September, 2021 10:14 PM

───

MY FELLOWSHIP AT HARVARD finished in the spring. I flew to the Middle East, where Drew was completing a Fulbright. It took some effort, but I managed to hide from Drew how poorly I was doing, or at least I thought I did. I probably didn’t. He was, after all, the one chasing me through his flat when I awoke in the middle of the night, screaming and sprinting, with no idea where I was but a desperate need to escape it.
30 September, 2021 10:15 PM

───

I RETURNED TO ENGLAND, where I continued to unravel. My first week back in Cambridge, I awoke nearly every night in the street, having run there, shouting, asleep. I developed headaches that lasted for days. My dentist said I was grinding my teeth. My skin broke out so severely that twice perfect strangers stopped me in the street and asked if I was having an allergic reaction. No, I said. I always look like this.

I was failing my PhD.

If I had explained to my supervisor, Dr. Runciman, why I was unable to work, he would have helped me, would have secured additional funding, petitioned the department for more time.

THAT AUTUMN, TYLER CONFRONTED my father. He talked to Mother first, on the phone. He called me after and related their conversation. He said Mother was “on our side,” that she thought the situation with Shawn was unacceptable and had convinced Dad to do something. “Dad is taking care of it,” Tyler said. “Everything is going to be fine. You can come home.”

WINTER WAS LONG THAT YEAR, the dreariness punctuated only by my weekly counseling sessions and the odd sense of loss, almost bereavement, I felt whenever I finished one TV series and had to find another.
30 September, 2021 10:17 PM

───

ON MY TWENTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY, the birthday I had chosen, I submitted my PhD dissertation. The defense took place in December, in a small, simply furnished room. I passed and returned to London, where Drew had a job and we’d rented a flat.

It was spring when I arrived in the valley. I drove along the highway to the edge of town, then pulled over at the drop-off overlooking the Bear River. From there I could look out over the basin, a patchwork of expectant fields stretching to Buck’s Peak. The mountain was crisp with evergreens, which were luminous set against the browns and grays of shale and limestone. 
30 September, 2021 10:18 PM

───

I BACKTRACKED A QUARTER mile into town and parked beside Grandma-over-in-town’s white picket fence. In my mind it was still her fence, even though she didn’t live here anymore: she had been moved to a hospice facility near Main Street.
30 September, 2021 10:20 PM

───

TYLER AND STEFANIE LIVED a hundred miles north of Buck’s Peak, in Idaho Falls. It was there I planned to go next, but before leaving the valley, I wrote my mother. It was a short message. I said I was nearby and wanted her to meet me in town. I wasn’t ready to see Dad, I said, but it had been years since I’d seen her face. Would she come?
30 September, 2021 10:20 PM

───

THE PARKING LOT HAD filled while I was reading. I let her words settle, then started the engine and pulled onto Main Street. At the intersection I turned west, toward the mountain. Before I left the valley, I would set eyes on my home.

GRANDMA-OVER-IN-TOWN DIED ON MOTHER’S Day.

I was doing research in Colorado when I heard the news. I left immediately for Idaho, but while traveling realized I had nowhere to stay. It was then that I remembered my aunt Angie, and that my father was telling anyone who would listen that she had put his name on a terrorist watch list. Mother had cast her aside; I hoped I could reclaim her.
30 September, 2021 10:20 PM

───

A YEAR WOULD PASS before I would return to Idaho.

A few hours before my flight from London, I wrote to my mother—as I always did, as I always will do—to ask if she would see me. Again, her response was swift. She would not, she would never, unless I would see my father. To see me without him, she said, would be to disrespect her husband.

When I was a child, I waited for my mind to grow, for my experiences to accumulate and my choices to solidify, taking shape into the likeness of a person. That person, or that likeness of one, had belonged. I was of that mountain, the mountain that had made me.
