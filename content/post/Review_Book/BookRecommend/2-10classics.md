### 1. A Tale of Two Cities By Charles Dickens
Because Dickens showed he could write magnificent historical fiction with this dramatic story of the French Revolution.

### 2. Brideshead Revisited By Evelyn Waugh
Because Waugh could string sentences together like few others. Posh family goes to pieces in style.

### 3. The Mayor of Casterbridge By Thomas Hardy
Because you should never sell your wife and child. I can't read too much Hardy as he does go on, but this novel shows what goes around comes around.

### 4. Don Quixote By Cervantes
Because knights are not always like King Arthur’s crowd.Some of them are crazy. Four hundred years old and still going strong.

### 5. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland By Lewis Carroll
Because children's literature does not have to be predictable. Again, I had to have children to discover this baffling fantasy story.

### 6. The Picture of Dorian Gray By Oscar Wilde
Because losing your looks is a terrible thing but selling your soul is much worse. This drama has so many themes.

### 7. Nineteen-Eighty Four By George Orwell
Because totalitarianism is not a nightmare — it's a reality for millions of people. This terrifying novel shaped modern culture.

### 8. To Kill a Mockingbird By Harper Lee
Because race continues to be the defining, and dividing, issue of modern America. Atticus Finch is a hero beyond compare.

### 9. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy By John le Carr&eacute;
Because this novel defined the Cold War era after World War II. A real page-turner as well even if you dislike spy stories.

### 10. Animal Farm By George Orwell
Because a little bit of politics is easily digested when set in a farmyard. Orwell wrote so few books and yet they all matter.
