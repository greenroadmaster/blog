### 1. Anne of Green Gables By L.M. Montgomery
Because redhead Anne Shirley is one of the strongest female characters in children’s literature. Both my daughters love this story.


### 2. Of Mice and Men By John Steinbeck
Because it’s less than 200 pages of pure genius. This novella offers friendship and heartbreak during a torrid time for America.

### 3. The Children of the New By Frederick Marryat
Because this often forgotten children’s novel is filled with adventure and intrigue. Also the forest is a fantastic setting.

### 4. Heidi By Johanna Spyri
Because life’s good on a mountainside. Heidi transforms her Alm Uncle and that's just the start of this heartwarming story of the Alps.

### 5. For Whom the Bell Tolls By Ernest Hemingway
Because this novel touches on so many themes, including death and sacrifice. Different to other war novels because it focuses so much on one person.

### 6. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest By Ken Kesey
Because Nurse Ratched is terrifying. This tale of a patient who fakes insanity to land a place on psychiatric ward is funny, sad and touching.

### 7. Fahrenheit 451 By Ray Bradbury
Because this is the ultimate dystopian nightmare for bibliophiles. It’s highly amusing to discover this book has been banned several times over the years.

### 8. The Illustrated By Ray Bradbury
Because these 18 science fiction short stories, tied together by the illustrated man covered in tattoos, are as relevant today as they were in 1951.

### 9. The Secret Garden By Frances Hodgson Burnett
Because fresh air and nature can heal many things. This Edwardian classic is almost as good as a self-help book in its messaging but more fun to read.

### 10. Brighton Rock By Graham Greene
Because Pinkie Brown is a nasty piece of work at just 17. An underworld thriller with a little bit of religion thrown in.
