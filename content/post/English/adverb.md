## Examples of Adverbs in Sentences

Adverbs can mystify writers because they have a number of different functions within the English language. Reviewing examples of adverbs and adverb phrases can help you identify them and use this part of speech effectively. With a couple adverbs by your side, you can add further description, describe an action, or intensify the meaning of another word.

## Spotting an Adverb

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They can add to or change the meaning of a word. A great way to spot adverbs is to look for words that end in -ly.

Let's take a look at a few examples:

Abruptly: I thought the movie ended abruptly.
Beautifully: The beautifully painted landscape is a wonderful addition to my living room decor.
Delicately: Grandma's crystal vase is a priceless antique that must be handled delicately.
Delightfully: Her outfit showcased her delightfully quirky personality.
Firmly: The teacher firmly disciplined the students for their misbehavior.
Lightly: She lightly dusted the brownies with a layer of powdered sugar before serving.
Truthfully: She truthfully answered the police officer's questions.
Quickly: Quickly finish the grocery shopping so we can get to the party in time.
Wearily: At the end of a long day, she wearily headed to bed.
Willfully: I sent my son to bed early for willfully refusing to eat his vegetables.
If you're a teacher, our activities with adverbs and lessons about adjectives vs. adverbs can help your students learn to spot adverbs effectively.

Wholeheartedly: I wholeheartedly believe education is the key to a better future.

## Adverbs Tell When It Happened

Examples of adverbs that describe when an action occurred include:

## Adverbs Tell the Extent of the Action

Adverbs also describe the extent to which something was done, including:

Almost: I almost stopped at McDonald's for lunch, but I was running late.

So: I am so hungry, I could eat a horse.
Too: It is too loud in here for me to concentrate.
Very: Baby Emily was very tired after missing her afternoon nap.

## Adverbs Are Intensifiers

Another function of adverbs is to intensify the meaning of the word it's modifying. It does this by putting more or less emphasis on the word, amplifying the meaning of the word, or toning down the feeling of the word.

Here are some sentences with the emphasizing adverb in bold:

He literally wrecked his car.
I am certain of the facts, for sure.
You simply don't understand.
I really don't care what you think.

Sentences that amplify would be like:

She _completely_ rejected his proposal.
I _heartily_ endorsed the new restaurant.
He _totally_ gets me.
I _absolutely_ refuse to stay here any longer.

Adverbs and adverb phrases that tone down the feeling or mood include:

You can improve on this to some extent.
The boss almost quit his job after that.
I somewhat understand what you are saying.
She mildly disapproved of his actions.
