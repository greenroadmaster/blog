In my opinion, the caliber is the best. It is the oldest ePUB reader and has excellent features such as metadata management, cover management and file transfer from one device to another.

Today, I am going to add another function of the caliber, the automatic translation function. If you ever feel the Caliber's built-in English-English dictionary is lacking, read on.

Start right away.

## With Google Translate

First of all, it is our turn to copy the link from Google Translate.
First, open one of the web browsers, Chrome. Bing or any other browser doesn't matter.

first. Open Google Translate and enter. The address is https://translate.google.com here.

The next important thing is to choose the language you want to translate and the language you want to translate into. I want to translate English into Korean, so I chose Detect Language as English and the rest as Korean.

Now copy the address at the top of your browser. I have copied
https://translate.google.com.my/?hl=en&tab=TT&sl=en&tl=en&op=translate
This address has been copied.

## When the Caliber English Dictionary is not visible (skip if there is)

Let's go back to the caliber. and Just click [Ctrl+L]

or...

The caliber is different. Before we start, we need to find the built-in dictionary. Here are a few things in case you don't see the built-in dictionary.

The dictionary is in the toolbar, the toolbar is in the preferences, and the preferences are right-clicked in the viewer. It's easy to say, but quite difficult when you first start. I will say it again slowly.

If you don't see the dictionary
right click
Click on Preferences
Click Customize Toolbar
English electronic dictionary click

Again, the words are easy, but a little difficult. I admit it.

## From Caliber English Dictionary

If you look at the English dictionary built into the Caliber Viewer, you will see a button called Add Website at the bottom.

Now click on that button 'Add Website' and then 'Add' button.
You can enter your name and address here.
If you decide to translate English to Korean with Google Translate, it is as follows.

Enter the name as 'English-Korean'.
address is as below

```
This is a copy link from google ->
https://translate.google.com.my/?hl=en&tab=rT&sl=en&tl=en&op=translate

The physical address to add to the viewer. ->
https://translate.google.com.my/?hl=en&tab=rT&sl=en&tl=en&text={word}%0A&op=translate
```
Yes! The number of characters is slightly longer. Let's take a closer look at what we've added.
Yes. Just *&text={word}%0A* added this part.

This function automatically sends the word to Google Translate to the address below when you click on a word in the caliber viewer.

When you're done entering, save and you're done.


## Confirm

Now look at the book with the caliber viewer and click on difficult words when they come up. And if you click 'English-Korean' on the website, you can see that the word is automatically translated.

## Tips here!

Google Translate has the ability to save words. When you click on the star mark, the word is automatically saved to Google Drive. Therefore, to save words, you must log in to Google, and if you are logged in, they are automatically saved.

If you click the 'saved' button at the bottom of the Google Translator later, all the words saved so far are printed out, and this data can be printed out as a Google document.
