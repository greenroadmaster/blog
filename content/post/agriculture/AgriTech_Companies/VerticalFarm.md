브룸버그 그린에 소개된 3년된 수직농원 스타트업 Bowery에 관한 이야기입니다. 이 기업은 뉴저지의 공단에 위치해 있습니다.

수직농원은 햇빛, 물, 영양소를 인공지능 소프트웨어에 의해 제어되고 있으며 이 수직농원에서 일하는 소수의 인력의 작업지시역시 스프트웨어의 계획에 의해 지시되며 그 정확성이 매우 높습니다.

여기에서 말하는 수직농원의 목적은 2050년에 전세계 인구가 100억명에 달하면 반드시 발생하는 식량부족의 문제에 대해 더 적은 리소스로 더 많은 식량을 생산하는 미래식량부족에 대한 대안을 제시하는 것입니다.

이 회사는 실리콘벨리의 투자자들로부터 3천만달러의 투자금을 받았습니다.

Its farm is here, in this industrial park in New Jersey. It might look like we're inside a spaceship, but this is actually a farm.

The crops here are grown mostly by machines with the help of just a few humans, like this woman.

Her life offers an early peek at a new kind of farming.

It's a promising twist to an ancient career, but only if the robots don't replace her altogether.

As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future.

My name is Katie Morich, and I'm a vertical farmer. Katie works for a three year old startup called Bowery.


Its farm is here, in this industrial park in New Jersey. 

```
How are you?
It's the last place you'd expect to find any sign of life.
We take extra precaution to make sure we're not bringing any contaminants into the farm, so we're gonna wear hairnets, and then this is just gonna cover all your street clothes.
```

Katie wears a clean uniform every day.
Visitors like me are handed a non-negotiable jumpsuit.

```
Alright.
Step inside and you'll see a cross between a factory and a lab.
```

Trays of produce are vertically stacked to save space, and each of them is given just the right amount of light, water and nutrients at the optimal temperature and humidity.

It's an incredible level of precision, which is why Katie can grow more faster with less water and no pesticides. 

It's also what let's her grow things that taste like nothing you've ever had before.

```
What's this?
This is the sorrel.
Mmm.
That tastes like candy apple.
Whoa! That's good, right?
It's so sour. I know.
```

The majority of this facility is automated.
The data is collected by sensors and a computer controls growing conditions for the crops.
For the things that the machines can't do yet, Katie and her fellow human farmers fill in, and even those tasks are dictated by the software that runs this whole operation.

```
It lets me know what I have to do, what time I should be doing it by, and that's how I get my day done. 
Do you ever, like, rebel against the computer's orders?
Uh, once in a while, if we're trying to do a little experiment of our own, we'll be like, okay, is the system telling us the correct things?
Most of the time it is.
All the time it's right. (laughs)
```

After a full day at the farm,
Katie likes to bring home samples to her husband, Jase,
(blender whirrs) and her cat, Burt.

```
Salt, pepper?
Maybe a little more... Garlic?
On the menu are two items from Katie's farm.
Basil, for pesto pasta.
That's so good.
And mixed greens for a salad.
I'm terrified, everyone's judging.
Cheers, guys.
Cheers. Cheers.
```

Katie fell in love with environmental science in college, but after graduating she struggled to find a full-time career in the field.

```
Jase had to deal with me a lot (laughs),
you know, coming home to me crying and trying to figure out if I'm making the right decisions.
And then, somehow, online, Bowery popped up.
She told me about this job, like, Bowery Farming,
it's like an indoor, vertical farm, and I was like, alright, this sounds like total BS.
So, I took my work truck and I said, "You know, let me swing around and see what this is all about."
So I drove up to it, doesn't look like there's a farm in there at all.
So I called her and I was like, "Listen, I know you're
psyched about this job, but it seems super sketchy."
But I figured I'd go and check it out for myself
and I pulled up and it was exactly as how he described,
but I gave it a shot.
```

And so in 2017, Katie joined Bowery.
She became employee number nine.

```
This is really my first real, full-time, big-girl job.
```

And it was a little intimidating at first, coming into this company with people that have like, their PHD and I don't necessarily have that background, so I constantly doubted myself when I first started at Bowery.

```
I wasn't worried about her at all, you know.
She said to us, "Can I do this?"
And I used to tell her to have a little faith in herself.
```

Katie grew up in a typical New Jersey suburb with two working parents. They've tried to stay away from putting too much pressure on their only child. When we heard about what she was doing and realized that this is something that didn't exist when we were younger and I thought back from my generation, 
you know, PC's came out when I started working and my parents probably would've said I was crazy if I went into an IT field at the time, but now look what happened.

So, it's not a good idea for us to try to tell her what to do because it's a different world.

Bowery is backed by some of Silicon Valley's top investors. And with almost $30 million dollars of funding, the startup is expanding fast. And in May, after all that time she spent doubting herself, Katie got promoted to lead a team of her own farmers. The produce she grows supplies a few nearby grocery stores as well as this restaurant in Manhattan.

```
It's less than 10 miles away from the Bowery farm.
What do you think?
It's delicious! (both laugh)
You made that.
It's like, crazy to see stuff I grew on a plate.
Alright, let me get some of...
```

But for Katie, it's not just about making premium vegetables for people who can afford them. I want people to have the purest produce imaginable, and I want that to be readily available to anybody.

The world's population is set to reach 9.8 billion people by 2050. Two-thirds will live in cities. And we're gonna need all kinds of new technology to sustainably feed everyone. The key to making that food affordable is to continue to make more with fewer farmers. But no matter how high-tech all this gets, Katie thinks there will still be a place for her.
I just think there's something about the human mind that you can't really replicate. So I think we could still work closely with technology, but I still think it's nice to have a human there.

It'll also be pretty lonely for the robots if they don't have anybody to talk to.
