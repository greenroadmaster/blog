G20 ITALY 2021  G20 Agriculture Ministers' Meeting  Communiqué  

1. We, the G20 Agriculture Ministers met in Florence on September 17-18, 2021 and reiterated our commitment to achieve food security and nutrition for all, and to ensure sustainable and resilient food systems, leaving no one behind.

+ G20 농업각료회의의 상시 주요논재가 식량 안보, 영양, 그리고 회복력 있는 식량 시스템임

2. Over the last decades, global agriculture and food systems have delivered a substantial increase in food production to feed a growing population and have improved food availability and access despite the continued exposure to a wide variety of risks. Nonetheless, six years since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a quarter of the world population still experiences food insecurity and the world is off-track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) Zero Hunger. This situation has been exacerbated by disruptions
related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

+ 식량은 증산되었지만 세계인구의 1/4은 여전히 식량불안정에 있어 SDG2030의 하나인 제로 기아를 달성하지 못하고 있음

+ SDG2030 이 매우 중요한 과제임 

3. We recognize that sustainable and resilient food systems are fundamental for food security and nutrition, contributing to healthy and balanced diets, poverty eradication, sustainable management of natural resources, conservation and protection of ecosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation. In this context, we welcome the recently endorsed Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition and encourage all stakeholders to actively contribute to promoting their use and application.

+ CFS의 Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition(식품 시스템 및 영양에 관한 자발적인 가이드라인)을 지지하며 권장함, 향후 리뷰하겠음

4. Emphasizing the commitments to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, we will continue to work to promote sustainable and resilient food systems that create benefits for people, planet, and prosperity and take urgent actions to address the causes and impacts of climate change and conserve, protect and restore biodiversity and ecosystems.

+ SDG 2050아젠다와 파리협정의 중요성을 재확인

+ 사람, 지구 그리고 번영이라는 단어의 중요성 재확인

+ sustainable and resilient food system 지속가능하고 회복력이 있는 식품 시스템. 앞으로 이 단어를 자주보게 될 것임

+ 기후 변화와 생물 다양성과 생태계를 보존, 보호 및 복원을 위해 긴급조치를 취할 수 있다고 밝힘

5. We are committed to working together to identify and overcome the major hurdles to meeting the SDGs and to inform our policies. We acknowledge and appreciate the ongoing activities of FAO and other relevant international organizations and bodies supporting our actions by reporting progress towards the SDGs and providing science and evidence-based policy recommendations.

+ SDG2030을 달성하기 위해 우선 기술, 과학, 정책을 지원하겠음

6. We recognize the need to identify paths for sustainable and resilient food systems and to find appropriate institutional, collaborative, and financial frameworks for their implementation, to overcome short and long-term challenges. Considering that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, we stress the urgency of factoring in different local conditions, cultures, histories, production systems, consumption patterns and traditions while designing sustainable, productive and resilient food systems transformation. The continued transition to sustainable food systems is a process that requires contributions by all stakeholders, and a continuous and inclusive dialogue. To this end, we will continue to work for sustainable and responsible agricultural supply chains.

+ 대신 지속가능하고 회복력있는 식품 시스템을 갖추기 위해 제도적, 재정적, 협력적 프레임워크를 찾아야 함. 이는 시급한 것으로 문화, 역사, 생산및 소비시스템이 지속가능하고 회복력있는 시스템으로 전환을 위해 노력해야 함

7. We recognize that there is no sustainable growth without economically viable agriculture that generates a stable and rewarding income and creates decent work and quality jobs and opportunities for farmers and agricultural workers, their families, and the rural communities. We acknowledge the importance of the prosperity of rural areas and the role of family farmers and smallholders in contributing to sustainable growth and the need to improve employment and business opportunities, and decent living and working conditions to make agriculture more attractive to women and youth. Such an inclusive rural transformation and revitalization would address the plight of at least 75% of the world’s poor who live in rural areas, and advance their equitable access to healthy diets. This goal requires easier access to education, capital, technologies and markets, public-private partnerships, and responsible investments in rural areas and rural infrastructures. We reaffirm, in line with “CFS - Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems”, the importance of promoting responsible investments in agriculture and food systems, especially to family farmers, startups and small- and medium-sized enterprises engaging innovative technologies that can support the transition towards sustainable and resilient food systems.

+ 지속가능한 성장에는 농부, 농업노동자, 그 가족, 농촌 사회를 위한 양질의 일자리와 기회를 창출하는 경제적 가능성이 없이는 지속가능한 성장이 없다고 인식함. 이를 위해 교육, 자본, 기술, 시장, 민관파트너쉽, 농촌기반시설투자에 더 쉬운 접근을 요구함

8. The social sustainability of food systems calls for more attention to the contribution of agricultural workers and communities, including seasonal migrant workers, to sustainable development and to ensure they equitably share the gains from this development through adequate earnings from their work. We will foster a policy environment that enables equitable, decent, and safe employment in agri-food value chains. We pledge to continue the dialogue on sustainable food systems and discuss ideas for adapting institutions to address new challenges. Recognizing the interaction of agriculture with climate, biodiversity, and natural resources, our actions should consider the economic and social impacts of transforming food systems, whilst ensuring a transition to sustainable models, leaving no one behind. We emphasize the importance of ensuring a holistic approach to this issue, jointly considering environmental degradation, economic opportunities, and social impacts. To achieve this goal and ensure social inclusion, age and gender equity and equality, youth, women, Indigenous peoples, and local communities must play a key role as part of the decision-making processes and solutions, including through a people-centered approach.

+ 농업노동자 등 농업노동에서 적절한 수입을 통해 이러한 발전의 이익을 공평하게 공유하도록 보장.

+ 발전을 위해 누구도 뒤쳐지지 않도록 할 것임.


9. We acknowledge that food loss and waste (FLW) is a global challenge and it requires urgent and collective actions. We renew our commitment to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses by 2030. Therefore, we welcome the efforts of the Technical Platform on the Measurement and Reduction of Food Loss and Waste and any other relevant regional and national initiatives and conferences to tackle this issue.

+ 식량 소비 효율을 높이는 필요성을 인정함. 1인당 쓰레기 음식물 절감 및 농산물 수확 후 손실절감을 약속함. 이를 위해 손실절감 및 폐기물 처리와 관련된 국가 이니셔티브 회의를 환영함.

10. The COVID-19 pandemic and other emerging infectious diseases, and zoonoses as well as the continuing challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), remind us of the close connections between human, animal, plant and environmental health. Based on the international OIE and Codex Alimentarius standards we stress the fundamental importance of applying a holistic multi-sectoral approach and reaffirm our commitment to implement the One Health approach to accelerate the global fight against AMR in agriculture and food systems and to prevent, reduce and manage biological threats and risks to agriculture and food security. We recognize and encourage the work of the Tripartite Plus organizations (OIE, FAO, WHO and UNEP) to strengthen the implementation of the One Health approach to combat AMR, emerging zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential and other threats to global health security, and welcome the One Health High-Level Expert Panel established by FAO, OIE, UNEP and WHO. Likewise, we renew our commitment to ensuring food safety across food systems. We welcome the continued work of the International Organizations in enhancing the capacities of countries to combat AMR. 

+ 새로운 전염병, 혹은 인수공통전염병, 항생제 내성(AMR) 등의 도전에 맞서기 위해 국제기구의 작업을 장려하며 환영함.

11. We will promote research and innovation to increase the resilience and sustainability of agricultural and food systems and to mitigate and adapt to climate change and halt and reverse biodiversity loss, and enhance plant and animal resistance to diseases, pests and abiotic stresses. We recall the vital role of characterization, in-situ and ex-situ conservation and evaluation of animal and plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and their exchange and availability for breeding, diversification of agriculture and research in accordance with internationally agreed frameworks, as applicable. We recognize that research is strengthened through shared principles of openness, transparency, reciprocity and excellence. We will work to enhance research collaboration and to improve the interface between science and policy.

14. Climate change, extreme weather events, animal and plant pests and diseases, and shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, threaten food systems across the world, can cause food shortages and exacerbate price volatility, and require coordinated and effective responses. We will guard against any unjustified restrictive measures that could lead to extreme food price volatility in international markets and threaten food security and nutrition.

+ 펜디믹과 같은 충격은 식량시스템을 위협하고 식량부족을 야기하기 때문에 이를 위협하는 모든 부당한 제한 조치에 경계할 것임

15. We recognize that international agri-food trade is critical for global food security and nutrition. We highlight the importance of an open, transparent, predictable, and nondiscriminatory multilateral trading system consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, to enhance market predictability, increase business confidence, and allow agri-food trade to flow so as to contribute to food security and nutrition. We welcome the WTO Members’ constructive efforts to make progress at the Twelfth WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12).
