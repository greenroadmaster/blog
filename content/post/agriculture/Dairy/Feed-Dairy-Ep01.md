## Ingredients of Feed

### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are the main components of plants and consist of crude fiber and soluble nitrogen. It is an energy source for the animal body and a basic raw material for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and amino acids.

#### crude fiber
In general, enzymes that decompose cellulose do not exist in the digestive juices of livestock, and microorganisms decompose them to obtain energy in herbivorous livestock. This occurs in the cecum in unitary herbivores, in rumen 1 and 2 in ruminants. Microorganisms produce volatile fatty phase (V.F.A) by decomposing Cellulise (a continuous complex of glucose).

#### soluble nitrogen
Among plant feeds such as starch and sugar, it is a cellular carbohydrate with high digestibility and most of the energy is supplied by this ingredient.

### Proteins

Protein in feed can be divided into soluble protein and insoluble protein. Soluble protein refers to a protein that is dissolved in the first stomach and destroyed by microorganisms. It also contains water-soluble nitrogen compounds. Ammonia (NH3) and amino acids (Aminoacid) decomposed by microorganisms are absorbed through the same digestive process as in unit animals while passing through the fourth stomach and small intestine as microorganisms.

### Lipids
When the crude fat in the feed enters the first stomach, it is decomposed into fatty acids and glycerin by microorganisms.

### mineral

salt (NaCl)
NaCl in salt exists in the form of ions in tissues and is a component of blood and fetal fluid. It is involved in osmotic pressure maintenance, muscle contraction, neurotransmission, amino acid absorption, calcium absorption, and gastric acid (HCl) production. If it is insufficient, foreign substances are eaten, feed intake and weight decrease, eye luster and hair lose luster, and milk production decreases.

Sulfur (S)
It is essential for protein synthesis and fiber digestion, and when it is deficient, loss of appetite, milk production, and weight decrease. When a non-protein nitrogen compound such as urea is used as a protein source, the sulfur requirement increases, so the ratio of N to S should be 12:1 when urea is added.

iron (Fe)
As an essential element for blood cell production, it is involved in the transport and use of oxygen necessary for the oxidation process in the body and cellular respiration.

Copper (Cu)
Necessary for skeleton formation and reproduction, and a component of enzymes.

Manganese (Mn)
Carbohydrate metabolism plays a role in cartilage formation, and when a deficient feed is fed, the calf delivery rate is high.

Zinc (An)
It is abundantly contained in zinc and glandular tissues and plays an important role in reproduction.

Iodine (I)
Synthesis of thyroid hormone Thyroxine, reproduction and growth, and prevention of diseases caused by vitamin E deficiency

### Vitamin
It can be defined as an organic compound essential for the normal development of animals or the maintenance of life in small amounts. In a small amount, it is involved in the biosynthesis of various compounds in the body tissues, in the maintenance of life or in the regulation of energy utilization and metabolism. Since ruminants synthesize vitamins B, C, and K due to the action of bacteria in the rumen, there is no need to separately feed these vitamins except for young calves.

<Types of vitamins>
Water-soluble vitamins B1, B2, niacin, B6, pantosan, biotin, B12
Fat soluble A, D, E, K
Other C, Choline, Inositol

### Total amount of digestible nutrients (TDN)

TDN = digestible organic nutrients (crude protein + crude fiber + soluble nitrogen + fat Ã— 2.25)
NE = GE - Minute energy - Required energy / Combustible gas - Heat generation
ME = maintenance net energy + caloric increase + net production energy

(G.E) Gross Energy
(D.E) Digestable Energy
(M.E) Metabolic Energy 
(N.E) Net Energy
