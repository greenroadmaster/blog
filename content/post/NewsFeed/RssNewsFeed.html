<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>는 원래 RDF Site Summary에서 출발하여 Rich Site Summary, Really Simple Syndication으로 알려진 웹 사용자 혹은 응용프로그램이 온라인 콘텐츠를 가져오게 된 표준규약으로 “자연어 처리”의 중요한 말뭉치(Corpus)의 한 축을 담당하고 있다.</p>

<h1>RSS 작업흐름 <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></h1>
<p>블로그 글을 기계가 긁어갈 수 있도록 웹사이트에 허락하는 경우 준비된 RSS를 가져오면 된다. 크롬을 사용하게 되면 “RSS Feeds URLs” 플러그인을 사용하게 되면 우측 상단에서 웹사이트에서 바로 RSS Feeds URL을 수집하여 <a href="https://feedly.com/">feedly.com</a>에 저장하여 관리하면 된다. 만약, 웹사이트에서 정보를 공개는 하지만 RSS Feeds를 제공하지 않는 경우 <a href="https://politepol.com/en/">politepol.com</a> 에서 수동으로 블로그 글을 추출하여 RSS Feeds URL을 생성시켜 <a href="https://feedly.com/">feedly.com</a>에 저장시키 활용하면 된다.</p>
<p>RSS 주소를 한곳 예를 들어 <a href="https://feedly.com/">feedly.com</a> 저장해 두게 되면 다음 단계로 이를 다양한 RSS 리더(Reader)를 사용해서 읽으면 된다. <a href="https://feedly.com/">feedly.com</a>은 안드로이드 앱도 지원하니 구글 계정을 연결시키면 끝. PC에서는 두가지 방법이 존재하는데 Windows Store에서 Readiy 를 설치하는 방법과 <a href="https://quiterss.org/en/download">QuiteRSS</a>를 설치하고 <a href="https://feedly.com/">feedly.com</a>에서 OPML로 내려받기 해서 이를 QuiteRSS에 연결시키게 되면 콘텐츠를 실시간으로 소비할 수 있다.</p>

<h1><code>tidyRSS</code> 헬로월드</h1>
<p>RSS를 R에서 가져오는데 <a href="https://github.com/RobertMyles/tidyrss">tidyRSS</a> 팩키지가 개발되어 수월하게 텍스트 데이터를 가져올 수 있다. RSS 텍스트 데이터를 처리하는 기본 작업 흐름은 다음과 같다.
과거 별도 RSS 팩키지를 사용해야 했지만, <code>tidyRSS</code>가 RSS, Atom, JSON, geoRSS 피드도 받아내는 기능이 있어 <a href="https://github.com/DataWookie/feedeR">feedeR</a> 팩키지를 참조해도 좋을 듯 싶다.</p>
